# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) re. Beaver Works Summer Institute

Note: BWSI is managed with just a few people that also have additional responsibilities, *PLEASE* make every effort to read or search this FAQ and to find the answers prior to emailing staff bwsi-admin@mit.edu .

| Question | Answer |
| ---- | ---- |
| Where can I get more information? | We try to keep our [website](https://beaverworks.ll.mit.edu/CMS/bw/bwsi) as up-to-date as possible. |
| Do you offer programs for middle school? | We piloted our first course last year with the Mini-RACECAR course and plan on adding more this year. Here is info on our [Middle school program](https://beaverworks.ll.mit.edu/CMS/bw/node/351) |
| I can't attend for the full month- can I come for just part? | Our program is very intensive and very competitive, so we ask that students applying *must* attend the full program. |
| What other STEM programs are available? | MIT has many programs [here](https://outreach.mit.edu) and Lincoln Laboratory has more listed [here](http://www.ll.mit.edu/outreach) |
| I'm a freshman/sophomore, can I apply? | We encourage interested students to be nominated to access the online course, but as we can only accept a limited number of students, accepted students are generally finishing their junior year (i.e. rising seniors) |
| I'm a senior, can I apply? | Current seniors are not eligible to apply (you should be getting ready for college and mentoring younger students) |
|I'm a parent, can I attend? | Only the *final* event is open to everyone and we encourage parents and friends to visit to see their student's success, but parents cannot visit during the program |
| What does the program cost? | The program is *free* for day students (students who are local or arrange their own local housing), residential students may be charged a $5,000 housing fee for the program, but we have information on fee waivers [here](https://beaverworks.ll.mit.edu/CMS/bw/Summer_Program_Application#overlay-context=bwsi) |


# Application process
| Question | Answer |
| ---- | ---- |
| Have I been nominated? | After nomination, students are sent an email that contains this [link](https://mit-bwsi.formstack.com/forms/bwsi_studentenrollment_onlinecourse_2020), if you don't have the password from your teacher, you cannot register. |
| I did not receive BWSIX (or online course) registration email- why not? | Emails are sent to the addresses provided by your teacher, very often our emails are blocked by school network firewalls |
| How can I get BWSI emails at my school? | Talk to your school administrator to allow emails from "mit.edu" through the school firewall |
| How can I get BWSI emails at non-school email address? | Provide a non-school email address to your teacher when you ask them to nominate you for BWSI |
| Can you change my school email address on the form? | Due to our limited resources it may be faster to ask your teacher to resubmit a new nomination form with an email that won't be blocked |
| What do I do after I get the BWSIX email? | See this [document](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1d_P8NgV6_GRblNVaFKq_uNasMmI42zw0) for more in-depth answers | 

# Online Course 
| Question | Answer |
| ---- | ---- |
| How long does it take to complete? | The length of time depends on your experience and skills, as well as the course selected, but encourage applicants to start early as it may take several weekends to complete a course. |
| I'm having trouble logging into BWSIX, what can I do? | See this [document](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1d_P8NgV6_GRblNVaFKq_uNasMmI42zw0) for more in-depth answers |
| Can I take more than 1 online course? | You are eligible to work on more than 1 course (courses like RACECAR require it), voluntarily complete additional courses does not improve your chance of acceptance, but can provide interesting learning opportunities. |
| How do I ask questions about course material? | We use Piazza as a forum for online course collaboration, you can register for an account on Piazza but course codes are ONLY available through the individual BWSIX course. | 
|How do I register for Piazza? | Check the Introductory module or Course Updates in individual course for links and access code |
